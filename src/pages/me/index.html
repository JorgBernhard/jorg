        <h2>Just Me.</h2>
        <p>
          I'm 54 years old, born in Germany, studied administration and logistics. I'm married and have a daughter, challenge my self every day as a cook, "it helps getting my mind off things".
          <br><br>
          UI/UX-Design.
          <br><br>
           I have very good skills, self-made, in web-design, 3 years of teaching design in São Paulo. I created over 50 web-pages, logos, marketing templates and flyers.  
          <br><br>
          Administration.
          <br><br>
          Working as a consultant has increased my experience in developing business strategies to increase productivity,
          establishing balance between the company-areas and there teams. 
          Over the years I have developed a constantly growing knowledge of computer-science, build and set-up servers, and created wifi net-works.
          <br><br>
          Programming.
          <br><br>
          I'm becomming a full stack programmer in java script, increasing my knowledge, developing and upgrading my soft-skills, 
          all this is bringing me up to speed.
          <br><br>
          I also speak several languages... (it comes handy). 
          <br><br>
          Happyness.
          <br><br>
          I believe that the foundation to a great job is your private life where you have the possibility of balancing your job out, having fun and enjoying all the work. 
          Well, so here I go, my new challenge being a Full-Stack Developer, with soft-skills and the ability of managing and coordinating all the work.
          <br><br>
          Studdy.
          <br><br>
