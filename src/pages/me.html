          <h2>Just Me.</h2>
          <p>
            I'm 54 years old, born in Germany, studied administration and logistics. Married and have a daughter. I challenge my self every day as a cook, "it helps getting my mind off things".
            <br><br>
            UI/UX-Design.
            <br><br>
             I have very good skills, self-made, in web-design, 3 years of teaching design in SÃ£o Paulo. I created over 50 web-pages, logos, marketing templates and flyers.  
            <br><br>
            Administration.
            <br><br>
            Working as a consultant has increased my experience in developing business strategies to increase productivity,
            establishing balance between the company-areas and there teams. 
            Over the years I have developed a constantly growing knowledge of computer-science, build and set-up servers, and created wifi net-works.
            <br><br>
            Programming.
            <br><br>
            I'm becomming a full stack programmer in java script, increasing my knowledge, developing and upgrading my soft-skills, 
            all this is bringing me up to speed.
            <br><br>
            I also speak several languages... (it comes handy). 
            <br><br>
            Happyness.
            <br><br>
            I believe that the foundation to a great job is your private life where you have the possibility of balancing your job out, having fun and enjoying all the work. 
            Well, so here I go, my new challenge being a Full-Stack Developer, with soft-skills and the ability of managing and coordinating all the work.
            <br><br>
            Studdy.
            <br><br>
            I'm finishing my study's at Cubos Academy in July, and anxious to start fresh.</p>
